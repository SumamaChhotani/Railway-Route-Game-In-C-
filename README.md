**Railway Routes Game - C++ Project**

**Overview**

This C++ project, developed as a two-person game for Swarthmore College lab, focuses on building railway routes using graph-based algorithms. The implementation incorporates fundamental algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient route planning and optimization.

**Features**
**Graph-Based Algorithm:** The project revolves around the utilization of graph-based algorithms to construct railway routes. The underlying graph structure provides a flexible and efficient framework for modeling and navigating the railway network.

**BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm:** These essential algorithms are employed for various aspects of the game. BFS aids in exploring the railway network systematically, DFS provides flexibility in traversal, and Dijkstra's Algorithm is utilized for optimizing route paths.

**Top-Down Design:** The project adopts top-down design principles, emphasizing breaking down the system into modular components. This approach facilitates better organization, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

**Game Dynamics:** The game dynamics involve strategic planning of railway routes between two players. The utilization of graph algorithms ensures that routes are not only feasible but also optimized for efficiency.

**How to Play**

**Setup:** Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler.
**Game Start:** Enter the game environment and initiate the railway route building process.
**Algorithmic Decisions:** Make strategic decisions using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm to construct efficient railway routes.
**Two-Player Interaction:** Engage in a dynamic two-person game, where each player competes to build the most optimized railway routes.
Programming Techniques
The project showcases good programming techniques, emphasizing top-down design, modular code organization, and the application of efficient graph algorithms. These techniques contribute to a well-structured and comprehensible codebase, ensuring the project's scalability and ease of maintenance.
